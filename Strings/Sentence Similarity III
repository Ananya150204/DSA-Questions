Idea : Tokenise the strings. The simple way of iterating from the left and breaking etc fails for the test case S1 = "A" and
S2 = "a A b A". The correct way is to keep matching from the front. When it does not match, match from the back. Finally,
check if S2's words are all done. If not done, there is some extra word in S2 and return false.
