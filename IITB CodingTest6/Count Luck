Idea : Parse the Grid: Read the grid dimensions and the content.
Find Start and Portkey Positions: Identify the start ('M') and portkey ('*') positions in the grid.
Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS): Implement a search algorithm to navigate from the start to the portkey while counting the decision points (cells where there is more than one possible move).
Compare Count with 𝑘.
