Idea : First, create a two-dimensional array of integers in order to keep track of the visited locations in the board, and a two-dimensional array of strings in order to keep track of the kind of movements that you performed while moving in the board.
After this, create a queue in which you will process all the possible movements that you will make. In the queue, you will insert an object which denotes the current position in the board (its coordinates), the number of movements performed until that point, and the current movement that you are doing (one of the possible options, UL, UR, R, LR, LL, or R).
If you are able to reach the destination point, break from the loop and then try to iterate backward to the starting position (insert the current position in a stack while moving, in order to print the path in the required order that is mentioned in the problem statement).
