Idea : I am happy that the idea about the contribution of each element struck you. I know it was a result of the Div 992C
problem. That's a glimmer of hope and an indication that we are growing every passing day. Now what's the contri ? Just a
hint; it continues to be the minimum on the right until it finds the next smaller element. Write a similar statement for the
left.
