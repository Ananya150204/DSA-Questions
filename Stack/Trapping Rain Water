https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/
Idea : Before talking about anything else let me know of the mental barrier which makes you think that the height of water
on a building depends on the immediate left and right neighbours of the building as this is probably the third time this has
happened. Clearly, can be done using prefix and suffix arrays (can remove prefix array). To optimise space keep a left and 
a right pointer. Update leftMax if arr[l] <= arr[r]. This ensures that u r always looking at the smallest among the left and
the right.
