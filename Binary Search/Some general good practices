In BS on answers try to keep the initial difference between low and high as small as possible.
Do not keep low as 0 and high as some sum (maybe) blindly.
Check if low is pointing to the impossible answer initially. If it is, after binary search it will
point to the correct answer finally. Similar comment for high
