In BS on answers try to keep the initial difference between low and high as small as possible.
Do not keep low as 0 and high as some sum (maybe) blindly.
Check if low is pointing to the impossible answer initially. If it is, after binary search it may
point to the correct answer finally. Similar comment for high. But do check if low is actually 
possible. Maybe there exists a test case such that the answer is -1.
