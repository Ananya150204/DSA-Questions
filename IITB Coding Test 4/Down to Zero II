Idea : dp is obvious. But how ? 
Breadth-First Search (BFS) ensures that we explore all possible moves level by level, guaranteeing that we find the minimum number of moves.
Dynamic Programming (DP): The dp vector stores the minimum number of moves required for each number, preventing reprocessing and ensuring efficiency.
Queue: The queue is used to manage the states to be explored, maintaining the current number and the count of moves taken to reach that number.
